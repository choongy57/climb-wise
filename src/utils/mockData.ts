export const mockCoachingAdvice = `Great effort on this route! I can see you're making good progress, but there are a few key areas to focus on:

**Grip Efficiency**: You're gripping too tightly, especially on the jugs around 0:32. Remember that overgripping wastes energy quickly. Practice the "minimum effective grip" - hold just tight enough to stay on.

**Hip Position**: Your hip alignment could be improved. When you turn your hips toward the wall (especially at 0:14), you'll find better balance and reduce strain on your arms.

**Rest Strategy**: You're rushing through rest positions. Each rest is an opportunity to recover and plan your next sequence. Take advantage of these moments!

Keep practicing these fundamentals and you'll see significant improvement in your efficiency score. Your movement is already quite fluid - now let's make it more energy-efficient!`;
